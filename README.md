# Tweepy-Twitter-Stream-Example
This is my attempt at creating a well documented example of streaming Twitter using the Python package called Tweepy. With FollowerMode set to True, this will stream tweets from a user-defined list of Twitter accounts. With FollowerMode set to False, you can stream from all accounts with user-defined keyword filters.
