# Tweepy-Twitter-Stream-Example

This is my attempt at creating a well documented example of streaming Twitter using the Python package called Tweepy. I have searched high and low and most examples are either outdated or are very small and don't showcase enough or explain anything.

# Something to note

With FollowerMode set to True, this will stream tweets from a user-defined list of Twitter accounts. With FollowerMode set to False, you can stream from all accounts with user-defined keyword filters.

# Tidbit
I most definitely enjoy sharing code with others and helping people for free without EVER asking anything in return, but if you found this example useful and would like to buy me a cup of coffee or something, feel free to send a dollar or two to paypal.me/jhayes88 if you'd like. Tips are always appreciated <3
